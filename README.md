# object-detection-yolov8-coco
This is my Object Detection project using YOLOv8 on a COCO subset. I prepared the dataset, trained the model, performed inference and visualization, and evaluated its performance. The repo demonstrates the complete workflow with results and metrics for effective object detection.
